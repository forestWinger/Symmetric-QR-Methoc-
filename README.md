# Numerical Algorithms with Case Studies I's course project 1
---
This project implements the symmetric QR algorithm to solve the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix. The algorithm's accuracy, convergence behaviour, and sensitivity are analyzed.

The essence of this algorithm is to implement the spectral decomposition of a real symmetric matrix. One operation requires () flops, and the memory space occupied is of the order of ().

main_symmetric_QR.m is the main function of this project.
